# SDD ledger — Life Manager iOS final integration

## Scope

- Worktree: `/Users/anicca/anicca-project/.worktrees/lm-ios-integration-final`
- Branch: `feat/lm-ios-integration-final`
- Base: `006a4d862` (`canonical/main` at integration start)
- No staging/production environment or deployment mutation is permitted in this slice.

## Integration checkpoint

- Reviewed provider-cost branch `2fd0edea6` merged with a normal `--no-ff` 3-way merge.
- Reviewed mobile-backend branch `fec844d5f` merged with a normal `--no-ff` 3-way merge.
- `apps/life-manager/server.js` retains provider budget wiring and `/api/mobile/v1` routing.

## Route-cache contract slice — RED/GREEN

RED was observed before implementation:

- provider store tests used an unscoped `cache_key` query and `on_conflict=cache_key`;
- mobile store wrote `route` plus fabricated `mobile:<digest>`, `mobile:v1`, and `time_bucket=0` legacy values;
- follow-up migration contract was absent.

GREEN after implementation:

```text
node --test lib/route-cache.test.js test/mobile-store.test.js test/route-cache-identity-migration.test.js
34 passing, 0 failing
```

The canonical identity is `(uid, cache_key)`. Provider reads accept `get(key,{uid})`, and
`makeRouteCache` passes the authenticated UID to all durable reads/writes. Both adapters persist
`route_result` and exact `on_conflict=uid,cache_key`; mobile reads `route_result` first and falls back
to `route` during migration. Legacy NOT NULL fields are populated from actual request/provider facts;
missing facts or HTTP persistence failures are surfaced as retryable failures. Cross-adapter reads,
identical keys across tenants, and conflict inference are covered.

The additive migration is
`apps/life-manager/migrations/2026-08-08-lm-route-cache-identity.sql`. It adds missing columns,
backfills `route` into `route_result` without deleting old rows, retains the old provider
`cache_key` and mobile `(uid,cache_key)` conflict targets during the mixed-version window, adds the
canonical `(uid,cache_key)` unique index, and validates canonical rows with a staged
`NOT VALID`/`VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` check. No unsafe rolling column rewrite is present.

## Late approval/provider-budget slice — RED/GREEN

The first production HTTP contract run was 9/10: the callback reached the sender but the merged
Resend path correctly stopped before the external request because its fail-closed budget gate could
not read `lm_api_cost` or claim `lm_claim_provider_budget` in the old fixture. The callback therefore
returned `provider_receipt_missing` and made zero Resend calls. This was a fixture/transport contract
gap, not permission to bypass the provider guard.

`fc824447e` restores the complete boundary: late approval forwards the provider budget/cost hooks
and cost request id through `notify` into `mail-resend`, while the HTTP contract models the actual
ledger read, atomic budget claim, Resend request, and cost write. The test asserts one of each for
the first Send and no additional budget, provider, ledger, or delivery calls on replay.

The provider run required the declared local dependencies (`npm ci --ignore-scripts`); it changed
only the untracked `node_modules` directory. No tracked package or lockfile changed.

## Fresh route-cache re-review — GREEN

The re-review reproduced and closed two tenant-isolation regressions. An injected bare process
`Map` is wrapped at the mobile route boundary with a UID-prefixed physical key; a two-tenant
provider-call test proves identical request fingerprints never reuse one tenant's result. Durable
canonical writers store `v2:<tenant-bound digest>` keys while retaining the tenant-independent
request fingerprint for cache semantics and cross-adapter lookup. During the rolling window, a
database trigger namespaces old route-only mobile writes as `legacy-mobile-v1:<uid digest>` and
old provider `route_result` writes as `legacy-provider-v1:<uid digest>` before the retained global
`UNIQUE(cache_key)` arbiter sees them. The raw key remains in `legacy_cache_key`; current readers
fall back across canonical, raw, and legacy namespaces. No legacy row is deleted, and the exact
old `cache_key` and new `(uid,cache_key)` conflict targets remain available until old instances
drain.

The first provider attempt was blocked only by an absent local `ws` dependency (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`);
`npm ci --ignore-scripts` restored declared dependencies and the exact rerun passed. PostgreSQL was
not available locally, so migration evidence remains the exact SQL contract and adapter tests.

## Remaining integration gates

- Fresh review of this integration diff.
- Live isolated staging migration/readback and HTTP route/provider evidence.
- iOS build/route/UI integration, Maestro evidence/video, signed TestFlight archive and real-device
  user validation. App Store submission remains blocked until TestFlight validation is complete.

## Task 2 completion — Simulator local push deep-link

- A repo-external entitled Debug build imported the isolated staging session into the normal
  Keychain service; no handoff code or token entered product source or Git.
- A contract-validated `simctl push` used the real `chat.route_ready` stable message ID and matching
  cursor from staging read-back. The notification banner was visibly delivered and tapped.
- `push-deep-link.yaml` passed the stable-message and post-refresh assertions. The visible route
  title occurred once after refresh.
- Fresh verification: Fastlane 141/141 GREEN; Maestro harness PASS; H.264 evidence SHA-256
  `ef30e40d52101d217d2ddfeb790795d66f30ea1f9770bf026dd8323f68581dda`.
- Receipt commit `eace31095` is pushed; Telegram video delivery message ID is `9772`.

Task 2: complete (verification receipt commit `eace31095`; production APNs remains Task 5)
