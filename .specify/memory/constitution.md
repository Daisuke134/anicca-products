# Constitution v1.0.0 — CC BP Restructuring

## Governance

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **BP-First** | Every decision must cite a best practice source. No original solutions. |
| **Search-Before-Act** | Minimum 3 independent searches before any action. No guessing. |
| **Single Answer** | No options. No "maybe". One answer per question. |
| **Spec = Executable** | Specifications directly generate implementations. |
| **Test-First** | Tests precede implementation (TDD: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR). |
| **Simplicity** | Minimum complexity for current task. No premature abstraction. |
| **Context Economy** | Minimize token consumption. On-demand loading over static. |
| **Immutability** | Never mutate. Create new objects. |
| **Push Immediately** | Every edit = immediate commit & push. No confirmation needed. |

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Criteria | Blocker |
|------|----------|---------|
| Spec Review | codex-review ok: true | Yes |
| Implementation | All tests GREEN | Yes |
| Code Review | codex-review ok: true | Yes |
| User Confirmation | Manual OK on device/simulator | Yes |
