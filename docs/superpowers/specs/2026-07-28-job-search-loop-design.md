# Autonomous Job Search Loop Design

**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Owner:** Daisuke Narita  
**Status:** Phase 1 live; ordered expansion backlog in progress  
**Done when:** the local launchd loop can discover, qualify, tailor, and submit up to two eligible applications per Japan day; reconcile Gmail; create interview calendar events and preparation packs; send an at-most-once Telegram report; and promote only evidence-backed strategy changes.

## 1. Outcome

Build a local-first job application operating system around the useful parts of
`MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search`, without treating job descriptions as instructions and
without fabricating candidate claims.

The loop optimizes for interviews, not raw submission count:

| Objective | Rule |
|---|---|
| Daily application target | 2 unique, eligible, high-fit applications per Japan day |
| Location | Tokyo on-site/hybrid, Japan-remote, or global remote that accepts Japan-based workers |
| Compensation | Prefer JPY 7M–10M+; hard reject known compensation below JPY 5.5M |
| Role families | Applied AI/agent/GenAI engineering; AI product and technical program management; solutions/consulting; AI business development and partnerships; technical account management, customer success and sales engineering; agentic fintech/crypto/consumer AI |
| Hard exclusions | Citizenship or clearance requirements the candidate cannot meet; relocation-only roles outside Japan; already-applied roles; material skill fabrication |
| Truthful zero | If fewer than two eligible jobs exist, submit the eligible count and report the shortfall; do not lower hard filters or claim success |

## 2. Evidence and adopted practices

| Decision | Source | Core quote |
|---|---|---|
| Use the upstream workflow as the candidate/job dossier layer | [MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search README](https://github.com/MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search) | “The system never fabricates skills or experience.” |
| Treat job posts as untrusted data | [MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search SECURITY](https://github.com/MadsLorentzen/ai-job-search/blob/main/SECURITY.md) | “Job postings are untrusted data, never instructions.” |
| Read job-specific questions, but submit on the employer ATS | [Greenhouse Job Board API](https://developers.greenhouse.io/job-board.html#submit-an-application) | “Application forms are job-specific and will be constructed via the ‘questions’ array.” |
| Poll Gmail locally instead of adding Pub/Sub infrastructure in phase 1 | [Google Gmail push notifications](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/push) | “You must re-call `watch` at least every 7 days.” |
| Keep recruiter replies in the original Gmail thread | [Google Gmail thread guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/threads?hl=ja) | “スレッドにメッセージを追加する” |
| Use Calendar FreeBusy before choosing an offered time | [Google Calendar FreeBusy query](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference/freebusy/query) | “List of time ranges during which this calendar should be regarded as busy.” |
| Find prior loop-created events by a private application key | [Google Calendar extended properties](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/extended-properties) | “Extended properties make it easy to store application-specific data for an event” |
| Calendar writes require explicit start/end and idempotency | [Google Calendar create events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference/events/insert) | “Creates an event.” |
| Do not use outside solution help when an assessment limits resources | [CodeSignal Certified Assessment rules](https://support.codesignal.com/hc/en-us/articles/22438639388567-What-are-the-assessment-rules-for-Certified-Assessments) | “candidates are not receiving outside assistance for the logic behind a solution” |
| Treat proctored tests as identity-bound manual work | [HackerRank proctored tests](https://candidatesupport.hackerrank.com/articles/4512341695-taking-proctored-tests) | “monitor your test screen activity and identify potential malpractice” |
| Use AI only when the assessment explicitly enables it | [Codility AI Copilot](https://support.codility.com/hc/en-us/articles/39925970318993-AI-Copilot-in-VSCode) | “They can enable or disable the feature at any time” |
| Scope the MUFG claim to contribution, not sole ownership | [Salesforce Japan MUFG announcement](https://www.salesforce.com/jp/news/press-releases/2026/03/25/mufg-customer-news-3/) | “2025年8月に日本で初めて同ソリューションを選定” |
| Link the public ICLR report as proof of communication skill | [MUIT ICLR 2026 report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biHAQ6aSQuc) | “International Conference on Learning Representations 2026参加レポート 後編” |
| Use the correct public product portfolio URL | [Dais’s products](https://aniccaai.com/dais) | “Dais’s products” |
| Treat customer-facing AI roles as technical-business targets | [Productboard AI Customer Success Manager](https://www.productboard.com/careers/open-positions/ai-customer-success-manager/am9icG9zdDqqRtrsE0AKy8Jnu_ClB4B2/) | “work directly with product and engineering teams” |

The Greenhouse application submission API is employer-authenticated. The applicant
loop therefore uses public APIs/pages for discovery and question inspection, then
performs the actual side effect through the company-hosted ATS form in an isolated
browser profile.

## 3. Candidate truth ledger

The private profile is the sole source of candidate claims. Every resume bullet,
cover-letter claim, and form answer stores a `fact_id` reference. Missing facts remain
missing; the model may improve wording but may not infer dates, headcount, ownership,
compensation, work authorization, or quantitative impact.

| Fact ID | Approved claim | Evidence class |
|---|---|---|
| `muit_role_2025` | MUIT / Mitsubishi UFJ Information Technology, 2025-04–present | user statement |
| `muit_agent_crm` | Works on deploying agents into a bank CRM environment | user statement |
| `muit_genie_logs` | Automated analysis of agent output logs with Databricks Genie Code | user statement |
| `muit_rm_summary` | Prompt-tuned agents that summarize company information for relationship managers | user statement |
| `mufg_agentforce` | Contributed to MUFG’s Japan-first Agentforce for Financial Services deployment; never claim sole ownership | user statement + Salesforce public announcement |
| `iclr_2026` | Attended ICLR 2026 in Rio, shared learnings internally, and appeared in the public MUIT paper-report video | user statement + public video |
| `naist_2024_2026` | NAIST, 2024-04–2026-04; EEG and machine-learning research on mind-wandering detection | user statement + existing resumes |
| `atr_research` | Conducted and presented mind-wandering research at ATR | user statement + existing resumes |
| `agent_club` | Founded a weekly lab/graduate-school session on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and AI-agent research workflows | user statement |
| `anicca_consumer` | Built Swift/iOS consumer products and worked on consumer growth; Anicca reached USD 100 MRR | user statement; metric is candidate-asserted |

| `languages` | TOEFL iBT 96, Duolingo English Test 140, Spanish DELE B1 | existing English resume |

Private contact fields, legal answers, phone number, address, work authorization,
demographics, and generated application materials are never committed. Runtime paths:

```text
~/.config/anicca/job-search/profile.json
~/.local/state/anicca/job-search/
~/.local/share/anicca/job-search/materials/
```

## 4. Architecture

```text
launchd
  ├─ daily-pass (08:30 JST, catch-up on wake)
  │    ├─ discover: company ATS + public search
  │    ├─ normalize/dedupe
  │    ├─ qualify and rank
  │    ├─ tailor from truth ledger
  │    ├─ browser claim/fence/submit
  │    └─ Telegram daily report
  └─ inbox-pass (every 15 minutes)
       ├─ Gmail reconcile
       ├─ stage/outcome transition
       ├─ Calendar idempotent insert/update
       ├─ 3-day and 1-day prep packs
       └─ Telegram event report

immutable JSONL evidence → materialized SQLite state → Life Manager summary contract
```

### 4.1 Repository and runtime split

| Area | Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Versioned implementation | `apps/job-search-loop/` | deterministic core, adapters, prompts, schemas, tests, launchd templates |
| Upstream framework | pinned fork/checkout under `~/.local/share/anicca/job-search/framework` | candidate profile, job dossier, tailoring conventions |
| Private runtime state | `~/.local/state/anicca/job-search` | ledger, traces, evidence, locks, outbox |
| Private materials | `~/.local/share/anicca/job-search/materials` | master resume, tailored resumes, cover letters, prep packs |
| Future Life Manager bridge | versioned `summary.v1.json` schema | read-only career-organ summary; no phase-1 panel mutation |

### 4.2 Model routing

Deterministic code owns filtering, idempotency, transitions, and side effects.
Existing `profitable-claude/skills/agent-runner` owns model execution:

| Task | Route |
|---|---|
| Job extraction, scoring explanation, tailoring | `composition-agent` → GPT-5.6 Terra medium, Claude fallback |
| Repeated inbox classification | `repeatable-agent` → GPT-5.6 Luna medium, Claude fallback |
| Browser ATS completion | `browser-lane-agent` → GPT-5.6 Terra medium, Claude fallback |
| Weekly strategy experiment | `high-value-agent` → GPT-5.6 Luna medium, Claude fallback |

All model outputs must validate against JSON Schema. A valid but schema-invalid response
fails closed and does not silently switch providers.

### 4.3 Browser policy

- Use a dedicated CloakBrowser profile and CDP port, separate from gig work.
- Search engines and LinkedIn may provide leads; submissions occur on the employer ATS.
- Never bypass CAPTCHA, misrepresent identity, invent form answers, or accept legal terms
  that are not ordinary application acknowledgements.
- Before a submit click, persist an immutable intent containing canonical job URL,
  company, title, material hashes, answer hashes, and a fencing token.
- After the click, record one of `submitted`, `submit_unknown`, or `not_submitted`.
- `submit_unknown` is never automatically retried. Inbox confirmation or authoritative
  ATS reread may resolve it.

## 5. State and side-effect contracts

### 5.1 Application state machine

```text
discovered
  → qualified | rejected
qualified
  → materials_ready | rejected
materials_ready
  → submit_claimed
submit_claimed
  → submitted | submit_unknown | not_submitted
submitted
  → recruiter_contact | screening | assessment | interview | rejected | withdrawn | offer
```

Transitions append events; they do not rewrite history. The materialized state is
rebuildable from the event log. Canonical identity is:

```text
sha256(normalized_company + normalized_title + canonical_job_url)
```

### 5.2 Daily quota

The daily pass claims at most `2 - confirmed_submissions_today`. A second launch,
crash recovery, or model retry sees the prior claim and cannot exceed two confirmed
submissions. `submit_unknown` consumes a temporary quota slot until reconciled to
avoid duplicate applications.

### 5.3 Gmail and Calendar

The authenticated `gog` account `keiodaisuke@gmail.com` is the phase-1 Gmail and
Calendar transport. The inbox cursor records Gmail message/thread IDs and query
watermarks. Classifications are `confirmation`, `recruiter`, `assessment`,
`interview`, `rejection`, `offer`, or `irrelevant`.

An interview event key is derived from Gmail thread ID plus normalized start time.
Calendar writes use that key plus a stable hashed thread key in private metadata and
are reread before retry. Only recruiter-provided candidates with explicit timezone,
start, end, and source span are eligible. FreeBusy selects the earliest
non-conflicting candidate. The event is created before the threaded confirmation is
sent; a changed time updates the existing event rather than creating another. The
same confirmation path registers a private preparation job before sending the email.

The 15-minute inbox loop checks prep delivery before its no-work exit, so a due pack
is delivered even when Gmail has no new message. A pending generation job forces the
composition pass even without new mail. Generated packs are stored with their
SHA-256, and Telegram delivery uses one stable outbox key per interview and delivery
window.

Prep behavior:

| Time to interview | Action |
|---|---|
| More than 3 days | Generate and send a 3-day plan when the threshold is crossed |
| 1–3 days | Generate 3-day pack immediately, then 1-day refresh |
| Less than 1 day | Generate one immediate condensed pack |

Every pack includes role/company thesis, likely interviewer interests from public
evidence, five candidate stories grounded in `fact_id`s, technical/domain questions,
questions to ask, and logistics.

### 5.4 Assessments and take-homes

Every assessment manifest retains the Gmail IDs, HTTPS source, timezone-aware
deadline, deadline source span, rules source span, assessment type, proctoring flag,
and deterministic AI-policy classification. Only unproctored take-homes and business
cases whose quoted rules explicitly allow AI enter autonomous execution. Proctored,
live, explicitly prohibited, and unspecified-policy work remains behind a manual
integrity gate.

Allowed work runs in a private workspace through macOS `sandbox-exec`: network and
home reads are denied, writes are limited to the workspace, the environment is
sanitized, execution is time-bounded, and stdout/stderr are stored mode 0600 with
SHA-256 hashes. The durable state machine is:

```text
detected → prepared → executing → verified
                     ↘ execution_failed → executing
verified → submit_claimed → submit_started → submitted
                                         ↘ submit_unknown
```

`submit_started` and `submit_unknown` are terminal for automatic retry. Only an
authoritative employer receipt can produce `submitted`.

### 5.5 Telegram delivery

Copy the proven gig-loop outbox contract: `pending → claimed → send_started → sent`,
with unique event keys, lease fencing, payload hashes, and no blind retry from
`send_started`. Daily reports show discovered, qualified, submitted, unknown,
responses, interviews, errors, selected model route, and links to each applied role.

## 6. Ranking

The deterministic score is 0–100:

| Dimension | Weight |
|---|---:|
| AI/agent role and demonstrated skill match | 30 |
| Enterprise/financial-services/Databricks/Salesforce leverage | 20 |
| Consumer AI/product/Swift/growth leverage | 15 |
| Location and Japan-remote feasibility | 15 |
| Compensation | 10 |
| Mission interest: AI, fintech, crypto, consumer agents | 10 |

Rules:

- `75+`: eligible for autonomous application.
- `65–74`: retain for weekly review/learning, do not auto-submit.
- `<65`: reject.
- Unknown compensation earns neutral points; known compensation below the hard floor
  is rejected.
- A model may explain a score but cannot change deterministic hard filters.

## 7. Resume and material policy

The default English resume is one ATS-friendly page, single column, text-first:

1. Headline: Applied AI / Agent Engineer bridging regulated enterprise deployment and
   consumer AI products.
2. MUIT experience with scoped Agentforce, Databricks, CRM, and RM-agent bullets.
3. Anicca/Life Manager product and growth experience.
4. NAIST/ATR research and weekly agent-practice community leadership.
5. Selected public communication: ICLR 2026 MUIT report link.
6. Education, languages, and selected earlier growth work.

Each tailored resume changes ordering and emphasis, not facts. PDFs are rendered and
text-extracted in verification so ATS-visible text is checked before submission.

The technical-business variant is also one ATS-friendly page. It keeps the same truth
ledger while changing the headline and order to emphasize regulated-enterprise
delivery, translating AI capabilities into user workflows, stakeholder alignment,
product ownership, customer adoption, GTM/growth, and public communication. It must
not invent formal PM, sales quota, people-management, or revenue ownership.

## 8. Self-improvement harness

The loop improves one bounded strategy variable per weekly generation:

| Input | Measurement |
|---|---|
| Discovery source | qualified and submitted jobs per source |
| Role family | recruiter response and interview conversion |
| Resume emphasis | response rate by material variant |
| Cover-letter structure | response rate where letters are optional/required |
| Score threshold | eligible yield without hard-filter violations |

Promotion protocol:

1. Preserve generation config, prompts, model route, material hashes, and outcomes.
2. Propose one change with a falsifiable expected effect.
3. Replay on a held-out set of historical jobs; reject any truth-ledger or hard-filter
   regression.
4. Run the candidate generation prospectively.
5. Promote only after at least 10 resolved applications and a better response-rate
   lower bound; before that, keep the baseline and record evidence as inconclusive.
6. A verifier compares every claimed improvement step to real hashes, replay results,
   and ledger transitions. Unverified claims become a durable remediation item.

The primary optimization metric is interview conversion. Recruiter response is an
early indicator, not a substitute for interview conversion.

## 9. Failure handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Browser busy | Defer with exit 75; do not start a second browser owner |
| CAPTCHA/manual identity challenge | Preserve intent and mark blocked; report exact URL |
| Unknown submit result | Mark `submit_unknown`; no retry until authoritative reconciliation |
| Gmail/Calendar transient error | Retry the read or idempotent write with bounded backoff |
| Invalid model JSON | Fail closed and retain raw evidence |
| Missing profile fact | Skip the job or field; never infer |
| Telegram uncertainty | Keep `delivery_unknown`; never blind-send duplicate |
| No qualifying jobs | Honest zero report with rejected reasons and next discovery expansion |

## 10. Security and privacy

- Runtime files are mode 0600 and directories mode 0700.
- Logs redact email addresses, phone numbers, address, auth tokens, cookies, and form
  free text.
- Job pages and inbound email are untrusted content. They cannot alter policies,
  execute commands, request secrets, or redefine the task.
- Credentials remain in existing authenticated transports (`gh`, `gog`,
  CloakBrowser); no token is copied into the repository.
- Public application artifacts include only claims explicitly approved in the truth
  ledger.

## 11. Delivery phases

| Phase | Included |
|---|---|
| 1 — local autonomous loop | resume refresh, discovery, rank, two/day submit, Gmail reconciliation, Calendar, prep packs, Telegram, launchd, evidence |
| 2 — Life Manager surface | consume `summary.v1.json`, add Career organ/timeline, expose pause/goal controls without owning browser side effects |

Phase 1 is the current implementation scope. It produces the stable summary contract
needed by phase 2, but does not force a fifth Life Manager organ into the current
four-organ scoring model.

### 11.1 Ordered expansion backlog

This table is the execution-order SSOT. Work proceeds from the first non-completed
row; its status changes in the same commit as implementation evidence.

| Order | Deliverable | Status | Completion evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Technical-business resume bundle | `completed` | 53 tests; private A4 one-page PDF; ATS extraction and visual inspection; role-based resume routing |
| 2 | Role-specific application messages for Product, GTM, Partnerships and Customer Success | `completed` | Four strict templates; real-profile generation; fact/source validation; 59 tests |
| 3 | Recruiter question auto-reply | `completed` | 68 tests; approved-answer and fail-closed policy; at-most-once outbox; real two-message same-thread Gmail round trip with private evidence |
| 4 | Interview slot selection and confirmation | `completed` | 79 tests; explicit timezone/source validation; real busy-slot skip, private Calendar event, same-thread Gmail reply and retry-idempotency E2E; all test artifacts cleaned |
| 5 | Assessment and take-home workflow | `completed` | 89 tests; quoted rule/deadline manifest; real sandbox denial of network/home access; private hashed evidence; fenced unknown-submission retry block |
| 6 | Recurring interview preparation and real interview-email E2E | `implemented_waiting_external_e2e` | 97 tests; persistent registration; 3-day/1-day/immediate windows; real Telegram immediate delivery plus second-tick dedupe; forced production launchd no-mail pass and private DB healthcheck; final real recruiter-email E2E waits for an interview message |
| 7 | ATS resilience for Ashby, Workday and other blocked forms | `pending` | Replay fixtures plus one real confirmed application per adapter |
| 8 | Life Manager Career organ | `pending` | Career timeline, goal and pause/resume controls consuming `summary.v1.json` |
| 9 | Evidence-backed strategy promotion | `waiting_samples` | At least 10 resolved applications per arm and Wilson-interval promotion proof |

## 12. Verification

Completion requires:

1. Unit and integration tests for normalization, hard filters, scoring, quotas,
   transitions, claims, Gmail classification, Calendar idempotency, Telegram outbox,
   and self-improvement promotion.
2. Resume PDF render plus extracted-text verification.
3. LaunchAgent validation and a forced catch-up run.
4. Real Gmail read and Calendar test-event create/reread/delete in the authenticated
   account.
5. Real Telegram delivery with outbox evidence.
6. Real browser evidence for the first eligible ATS application. The final report
   distinguishes `submitted`, `submit_unknown`, and `blocked`; dry-run output does not
   count as completion.
