# Affiliate Agent Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build and launch an English-first, receipt-backed Affiliate Agent that autonomously researches, publishes, attributes, reconciles, repairs, and improves; unlock an isolated Japanese pod only after English public E2E is proven, then admit Spanish and later locales only through independent evidence and revenue gates.

**Architecture:** The legacy `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate` runtime is characterized and migrated into canonical `life-manager/skills/affiliate`. Terra-high observes and plans through a semantic CloakBrowser website harness, while a deterministic Python/SQLite kernel owns bootstrap, policy, budgets, idempotency, receipts, money, recovery, and Telegram delivery. `apps/api` owns the public placement redirect and durable click ingest. Writer/Gig/shared-browser contracts are reused by interface, but every money/state ledger remains isolated.

**Tech Stack:** pinned Python runtime, SQLite, pytest, Bash/launchd/systemd, Node.js ESM, Express, PostgreSQL/Prisma, Vitest/Supertest, CloakBrowser/CDP, CRWL, audited public-object adapters, optional Crawlee Python for durable crawls, and rendered-browser/download evidence. Postiz and external publishing APIs are excluded.

## Global Constraints

- Canonical design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-affiliate-agent-design.md`.
- Product context: `docs/affiliate-agent/AFFILIATE-AGENT-SSOT.md`.
- Runtime, API, and documentation changes belong to the canonical Life Manager
  monorepo. Legacy `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude` is read-only migration input.
- Mutable runtime truth belongs under `${LIFE_MANAGER_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state/life-manager}/affiliate/` and installed immutable releases under `~/.local/share/life-manager/affiliate/`; neither may be committed.
- Execute in isolated `.worktrees/affiliate-agent-*` worktrees created with `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`; never edit a dirty primary checkout.
- Use TDD for every behavior change: RED, minimal GREEN, focused suite, commit, push.
- Bootstrap a pinned runtime on the current macOS host; do not depend on
  an ambient `/usr/bin/python3`. Existing launchd remains untouched until cutover.
- Pin and checksum every non-system runtime dependency.
- Before every coding/design slice, search external URLs with CRWL, GitHub with
  `gh` plus a full clone, and docs with Context7. README-only inspection cannot
  justify reuse; inspect implementation, tests, current commit, and license.
- All research acquisition routes implement the typed `CrawlerAdapter` contract.
  Prefer official/authenticated interfaces, then installed CRWL, licensed
  public-object adapters, Crawlee/Scrapy, and finally rendered CloakBrowser.
  Empty, auth, rate-limit, parser, policy, and upstream failures remain distinct.
- `unknown`, `pending`, `approved`, `reversed`, and `paid` are distinct; unknown is never zero.
- Money uses integer minor units and ISO-4217 currency. Conversion is a derived receipted view.
- Test, dry-run, estimated, self-funded, and creator-claimed amounts never enter revenue.
- One canonical Affiliate ledger; never import Writer money rows.
- Every publish requires a provider receipt and public readback; every side effect is idempotent.
- Every placement carries an adjacent locale/channel-correct affiliate disclosure.
- English is first. Its verified X identity is `sela` / `@selawmqt`; legacy
  `@aniccaen` is inactive. Postiz and external publishing APIs must never be
  called. English and Japanese use different browser profiles/accounts, history,
  cohorts, experiments, and budgets.
- Japanese publication remains disabled until English Gate E0 has a public
  readback, working redirect, and provider click/sub-ID receipt.
- External pages, emails, and model output are untrusted data.
- Public redirect destinations are registered server-side; request input cannot select an arbitrary URL.
- Paid acquisition stays disabled until mature observed net economics are positive.
- Scale gates are external outcomes, not software-completion claims.
- Migrate the existing `skills/affiliate` tree in place; preserve legacy
  commission watermark, lessons, queue/posted history, and wrapper entrypoints.
- Runtime market/browser/content/recovery judgment uses `gpt-5.6-terra` at
  `high`; Luna cannot make money-affecting or publication decisions initially.
- Sol-high requires a one-use trigger receipt for legal/financial claims,
  high-value publication, new-provider or prompt promotion, and adversarial samples.
- The model proposes one typed semantic action; the deterministic kernel executes
  only allowlisted tools and verifies the result.
- Exact prompt copying requires a compatible license and provenance receipt;
  public creator workflows are paraphrased patterns, not claimed prompt copies.
- External creator playbooks are classified `COPY|TWEAK|REJECT`; self-reported
  income, predicted metrics, fabricated experience, and volume targets never
  become production truth.
- Every provider/program/surface requires a current `ChannelEligibilityReceipt`.
  Provider channel rules are read through rendered terms pages and receipted;
  owned registered pages are the default conversion surface.
- Every meaningful action creates a Japanese natural-language `ActionEvent` and
  durable Telegram outbox row; ambiguous delivery is never blindly resent.
- Implementation uses one isolated Terra-max engineer per task packet. The root
  session owns task selection, diff inspection, tests, SSOT, and live verification.

---

## Remaining-work index

Unchecked boxes are remaining work. A checkbox closes only with the command or
external receipt named in that step; prose updates alone do not close work.

Canonical start-to-finish order:

1. converge source into the clean canonical Life Manager worktree and receipt
   legacy equivalence without stopping any live loop;
2. close the F2 model/process boundary and deterministic typed-action kernel;
3. inventory authorized accounts, provision the isolated English browser, and
   preserve OTP/KYC/contract challenges as durable resumable states;
4. make one English provider offer executable from ownership, current terms,
   eligible channel, payout, and tracking-link receipts;
5. implement evidence acquisition, policy/disclosure, useful content, browser
   publication, public readback, signed redirect, and click lineage;
6. reconcile provider transactions through pending, approved, reversed, and
   paid, then emit the same snapshot to Telegram and Life Manager;
7. install and kickstart launchd, crash it at controlled boundaries, and prove
   same-run recovery without duplicate external actions;
8. close English E0 with a live placement/click—never with a fixture or dry run;
   E0 may unlock only a separate, capped Japanese canary while English continues;
9. close English E1 with the first externally approved commission, then operate
   daily until four positive weeks and three consecutive receipted USD
   10,000-equivalent gross months close A3;
10. publish a privacy-safe proof ledger and only then enable qualified “first”
    language in README and `aniccaai.com/life-manager`;
11. promote the Japanese canary, then admit Spanish/later pods only through their
    own identity, provider, disclosure, canary, ledger, and net-economics gates;
12. package the proven macOS runtime for one-command clean-device installation,
    then tenant isolation and staged diversified scale.

Execution-order override: prove the smallest revenue-bearing English vertical
slice on the current Mac before generic scratch-host portability. F0 supplies
only the minimum current-host authority/profile/runtime bootstrap needed by that
slice. Task 18 later packages the already-proven runtime for a scratch device.
The milestone order is R0 canonical convergence → current-host F0 → Local E0
(public placement and provider click) → Local E1 (first approved external
commission) → stable local daily operation → Task 18 portability → tenant
isolation and distribution.

Execution checkpoint:

- F1 is complete at runtime HEAD `5b1927dc` with clean task review and fresh
  root verification.
- F2 implementation commit `d9ad4acd7cb0474cf1a825a94cfb49e7847da22e`
  is pushed. Root replay on 2026-08-06 passed the focused 16 tests, Python 3.9
  compile/shell syntax, and 30 related regression tests. Its checkboxes remain
  open until fresh review, worktree-diff audit, live-provider boundary proof, and
  a collection-safe full-suite command; the process-boundary test uses a fake provider.
- 16 atomic checks are closed and 147 remain open. The increase records canonical
  repo convergence and public-proof work that previously existed only as prose;
  it is not implementation regression.
- The legacy core remains `DEAD`; no provider auth, public Affiliate placement,
  attributed external commission, production launchd wake, or Telegram delivery
  receipt has been claimed.
- `ai.anicca.affiliate-reconcile` and `ai.anicca.affiliate-daily` are not registered;
  `affiliate-core` tmux is absent. The runtime worktree also contains three
  tracked `__pycache__` deletions whose ownership must be audited before F2 closes.
- A passing unit test closes only its software check. It cannot close a live
  readback or external-money gate.

| Phase | Tasks | Exit evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| P-1 Canonical convergence | R0 | One canonical Life Manager production source, immutable install receipt, legacy parity, no live-loop interference |
| P0 Local money slice | F0 and minimum parts of F2-F6 and 1-13 | Current-Mac unattended application-to-publication-to-reconciliation loop with Telegram receipts |
| P1 Truth foundation | 2-5 | Typed Affiliate ledger, provider normalization, deployed redirect contract, click sync |
| P2 Useful production | 6-8 | Evidence/policy pass, locale-isolated manifests, receipted English public placement |
| P3 Closed loop | 9-13 | Commission reconciliation, learning, recovery, reports, launchd |
| P4 Real E2E and first money | 14-16J | Live HTTPS redirect; English E0 unlocks a capped Japanese canary while English proceeds to E1; each locale closes its own receipts |
| P5 Initial business and proof | 17, 17P | Four positive weeks, three qualifying $10k months, privacy-safe public ledger, qualified claim gate |
| P6 Portability and decentralized scale | 18-19 | One-command scratch-host package, tenant-isolated recipe, and staged network gates through $10M net, then an explicitly receipted $100M horizon |

### Implementation-entry blockers

Code implementation may begin only after these seven gates have explicit
receipts or fail-closed owners; business outcomes remain later live gates:

1. fresh F2 review plus a non-importing full test collector;
2. ownership audit for the three tracked `__pycache__` deletions;
3. canonical runtime root, branch, and entrypoint receipt;
4. current-host F0 authority/profile receipt plus browser ownership/readback for English
   `@selawmqt`; Postiz state is irrelevant and must not be queried;
5. shared browser/profile/credential ownership map with no stop/restart of
   unrelated money loops;
6. Affiliate outbox/dedupe wiring to the validated Life Manager Telegram target;
   live delivery `messageId=7639` closes target discovery, not outbox behavior;
7. production identity gate requiring browser-read account identity, offer ownership, current
   terms, eligible channel, and signed redirect before any publish.

Uncertainties close only by one of four dispositions: fixed design decision,
implementation test, live-canary measurement, or irreducible external constraint
with a named state/cap/quarantine. “Cleared” never means guessed.

The implementation path is P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4. Foundation tasks are
sequential because they establish shared contracts. Revenue operation P5 starts
after A1. Tenantization and network scale P6 remain disabled until A3 proves the
recipe with this Agent's own external receipts.

## Context-saving execution protocol

For each task, the root session creates one compact task packet containing only:

1. design requirement and current checkbox;
2. exact owned files and forbidden files;
3. consumed/produced interfaces;
4. baseline commit and current failing test;
5. required commands and expected evidence;
6. related prior receipt hashes, not the full conversation.

A fresh Terra-max engineer receives that packet with no full-history fork, works
only in the named worktree/files, runs RED→GREEN, and returns commit plus test
evidence. The root inspects the diff, reruns focused tests, performs any real E2E,
updates this plan/SSOT, and closes the task. Sol-high review is added only for
irreversible external action, money-loss risk, legal/financial claims, uncertain
strategy promotion, or the periodic adversarial sample. Tasks sharing runtime
state, auth, a browser profile, or a branch never execute concurrently.

---

### Task R0: Converge the Affiliate runtime into the canonical Life Manager repo

**Files:**
- Create the portable skill contract: `skills/affiliate/SKILL.md`
- Preserve byte-identical evidence: `skills/affiliate/legacy/**`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/legacy/SHA256SUMS`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/legacy/DEPENDENCIES.sha256`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/install-release.sh`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_repository_ownership.py`
- Update: `.gitignore`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes read-only legacy source and state from
  `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate`.
- Produces one `RepositoryOwnershipReceipt` containing legacy/source commit,
  artifact hashes, canonical target commit, missing dependency inventory,
  excluded mutable paths, and the one permitted launchd owner set.
- R0 proves source ownership and byte preservation only. It does not claim the
  legacy workflow is runnable or behavior-equivalent to the new English/X Agent.

- [x] **Step 1: Inventory legacy code, state, dependencies, and live owners read-only**

Measured ten tracked files and two ignored state files without reading secrets;
pure tests passed 16/16 and four shell entrypoints passed syntax checks. No
Affiliate launchd job, tmux session, process, or open file is live. The legacy
JP Instagram/Amazon slideshow workflow is not runnable as copied: its fixed-path
poster, composer, Amazon reporter, and ledger recorder are absent or moved.

- [x] **Step 2: Write one minimal failing repository-ownership check**

Assert that the canonical folder is a valid skill, committed active files contain
no `/Users/anicca` or `profitable-claude` runtime dependency, mutable state is
outside source, the legacy SHA manifest verifies, and no install activates
launchd. The byte-preserved `legacy/` evidence is exempt from active-path rules.

- [x] **Step 3: Preserve legacy truth and add the relocatable skill shell**

Copy the ten tracked legacy files byte-for-byte under `legacy/`, commit their
SHA-256 manifest, and add a minimal `SKILL.md`. Active scripts resolve their own
install root and `${LIFE_MANAGER_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state/life-manager}`;
they never execute the archived workflow or manufacture missing adapters.

- [x] **Step 4: Prove byte parity and record the behavior gap**

Verify all ten hashes and rerun the 16 pure legacy tests from the archive. Record
missing/moved dependencies as `UNAVAILABLE`; do not call that live behavior
parity. Runtime cutover remains blocked until later adapter and E0 tests pass.

- [x] **Step 5: Install an immutable canonical release without enabling it**

Install the exact pushed commit at
`~/.local/share/life-manager/affiliate/releases/<git_sha>` and atomically prepare
`current`; do not write `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, register, kickstart, or execute
the archived workflow. Mutable legacy state remains untouched; only a private,
sanitized inventory receipt may be written under `LIFE_MANAGER_STATE_HOME`.

- [x] **Step 6: Commit and push the canonical source**

Push the skill source before installing so the release SHA names an actual remote
commit.

- [x] **Step 7: Install the pushed SHA, verify, update SSOT, and push the receipt**

Install the exact remote commit, verify `current` resolves to that immutable
release, record the sanitized ownership receipt and disabled-cutover state in the
SSOT, then commit/push the progress update. Only then may later tasks modify
runtime behavior.

---

### Task F0: Bootstrap the Agent from a clean state on the current macOS computer

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/bootstrap/install.sh`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/bootstrap/manifest.lock`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/authority_inventory.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/profile_provisioner.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_bootstrap.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_authority_inventory.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_profile_provisioner.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `MachineCapabilityReceipt`, `AuthorityReceipt`, and isolated EN/JA
  `BrowserProfileReceipt` records.
- Consumes: the current macOS host with clean Agent state and an explicitly user-authorized authority
  bundle. Missing identity/OTP/KYC/contract capability becomes
  `EXTERNAL_CHALLENGE`, not invented data.

**Implementation basis:**
- Reuse the repository's R0 immutable install and atomic symlink pattern.
- Copy the pinned manifest plus two-stage checksum behavior from
  [OpenInterpreter's macOS installer](https://github.com/openinterpreter/openinterpreter/blob/c2a8c3371fe71fc3890c3e82798f54448c7ffe61/scripts/install/install.sh#L1018-L1107): it verifies the checksum manifest before the selected artifact.
- Copy only the action-state and temp-file rename behavior from
  [Nix Installer](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-installer/blob/b687af918ee7cb78be861542137395bb482111f3/src/plan.rs#L406-L425): a partial receipt is never installed as the canonical receipt.
- Do not copy Homebrew's moving-latest behavior or any installer that skips
  checksum verification when a utility is absent.

- [x] **Step 1: Write RED bootstrap idempotency and checksum tests**

Assert that a second install changes no pinned artifact, an unsupported OS fails
closed, every download is checksummed, secrets never enter logs/git, and an
interrupted install resumes from the last receipted step.

- [x] **Step 2: Write RED authority and profile-isolation tests**

Assert EN and JA never share cookies/storage, absent authority remains explicit,
authorized inbox OTP is scoped to one login intent, and CAPTCHA/KYC/contract
pages transition to `EXTERNAL_CHALLENGE` without bypass.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement minimal pinned installer and encrypted vault contract**

Install the exact runtime/browser dependencies, create state/log/download roots,
configure secret redaction and OS key storage, and emit hashes/versions. Do not
touch or restart existing money loops.

Progress receipt: the pinned-artifact installer, checksum gate, atomic resume
receipt, and intent-scoped `keychain://` reference contract pass 5/5 focused
tests. This step remains open because the current-host runtime/browser artifact
has not been admitted into `manifest.lock`, and no Keychain value has been read
back through the contract.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement semantic capability inventory and browser provisioning**

Discover existing authorized identities and sessions, create locale-isolated
profiles, verify the account handle after login/recovery, and persist only
encrypted session material plus sanitized receipts.

Progress receipt: EN/JA real-directory provisioning, deterministic isolated
ports, idempotency, typed external-challenge handling, and secret redaction pass
4/4 focused tests. This step remains open until authorized-session discovery,
account-handle readback, and encrypted session persistence are live-proven.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run clean-state E2E on the current macOS host**

Use isolated disposable data/state/profile roots without touching running loops.
Terminate and restart only the isolated bootstrap process between bootstrap and resume; prove the
same queue/profile identities return without duplicate account creation or any
external publication. This is environment E2E, not a mocked success.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit and push the bootstrap slice**

```bash
git add skills/affiliate/bootstrap skills/affiliate/scripts skills/affiliate/tests
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): bootstrap clean macOS state"
git push
```

### Task F1: Characterize and migrate the legacy Affiliate loop without losing truth

**Legacy files already implemented in the source repo and imported by R0:**
- `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate/scripts/legacy_migration.py`
- `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_migration.py`
- `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate/run.sh`
- `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate/affiliate-cli.sh`
- `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate/measure_commission.py`
- `/Users/anicca/profitable-claude/skills/affiliate/state/`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `LegacyInventory` and a content-addressed migration receipt; Task 11
  consumes the parity receipt before it owns compatibility-wrapper cutover.
- Consumes: existing watermark, lessons, queue/posted directories, tmux/launchd state, and legacy tests.

- [x] **Step 1: Capture read-only baseline evidence**

```bash
bash skills/affiliate/affiliate-cli.sh --status
python3 skills/affiliate/tests/test_affiliate_verify.py
python3 skills/affiliate/tests/test_measure_commission.py
find skills/affiliate -maxdepth 3 -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 shasum -a 256
```

Expected current runtime fact: core is `DEAD`; the two legacy focused suites pass
or any failure is recorded before migration.

- [x] **Step 2: Write the failing state-preservation tests**

```python
def test_legacy_watermark_is_imported_as_unattributed_history(tmp_path):
    result = migrate(fixture_tree(tmp_path), target_db=tmp_path / "affiliate.sqlite")
    assert result.watermark_class == "legacy_unattributed"
    assert result.new_revenue_minor == 0

def test_migration_replay_is_byte_stable(tmp_path):
    first = migrate(fixture_tree(tmp_path), target_db=tmp_path / "affiliate.sqlite")
    second = migrate(fixture_tree(tmp_path), target_db=tmp_path / "affiliate.sqlite")
    assert first.receipt_sha256 == second.receipt_sha256
    assert second.rows_added == 0

def test_legacy_files_are_not_deleted(tmp_path):
    root = fixture_tree(tmp_path)
    before = tree_hashes(root)
    migrate(root, target_db=tmp_path / "affiliate.sqlite")
    assert tree_hashes(root) == before
```

- [x] **Step 3: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_migration.py -q
```

Expected: FAIL because `legacy_migration.py` does not exist.

- [x] **Step 4: Implement inventory and append-only import**

Record path/hash/size/state for legacy artifacts. Import aggregate commission
watermark as `legacy_unattributed`, lessons as historical observations, and
queue/posted entries as legacy artifacts. Never manufacture click or placement
lineage.

- [x] **Step 5: Run GREEN and legacy regression**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_migration.py -q
python3 skills/affiliate/tests/test_affiliate_verify.py
python3 skills/affiliate/tests/test_measure_commission.py
```

- [x] **Step 6: Preserve entrypoints and receipt the Task 11 cutover dependency**

Do not invent a new orchestrator interface in F1. Prove `run.sh` and
`affiliate-cli.sh` are unchanged from the F1 base, record the migration/parity
receipt consumed by Task 11, and keep the legacy scheduler state unchanged. Task
11 performs the actual cutover only after `hourly_wake()` and `daily_wake()` exist.

- [x] **Step 7: Commit and push**

```bash
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "refactor(affiliate): preserve and migrate legacy loop state"
git push
```

### Task F2: Build the Terra Agent brain and receipt-gated model boundary

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/model-routing.json`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/runtime/model-runner.sh`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/agent_brain.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_model_runner.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_agent_brain.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `make_context_packet(state) -> ContextPacket` and `propose_action(packet) -> ActionProposal`.
- Consumes: bounded state/receipt/tool schemas; never raw credential files or complete logs.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing model-routing tests**

```python
def test_strategic_agent_defaults_to_terra_high(fake_codex):
    result = run_model(role="strategy", prompt="one action", codex=fake_codex)
    assert result.model == "gpt-5.6-terra"
    assert result.effort == "high"

def test_luna_cannot_receive_money_or_publication_role():
    with pytest.raises(ModelRoutingInvariant):
        route(role="publication_decision", requested_model="gpt-5.6-luna")

def test_sol_requires_matching_one_use_trigger(tmp_path):
    receipt = sol_receipt(tmp_path, trigger="new_provider_promotion")
    first = run_model(role="sol_audit", trigger_receipt=receipt)
    assert first.model == "gpt-5.6-sol"
    with pytest.raises(TriggerAlreadyClaimed):
        run_model(role="sol_audit", trigger_receipt=receipt)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing one-action output tests**

```python
def test_agent_returns_exactly_one_typed_action(fake_model):
    proposal = propose_action(context_packet(), model=fake_model)
    assert proposal.tool in ALLOWLISTED_TOOLS
    assert proposal.idempotency_key
    assert proposal.verification_plan
    assert proposal.human_summary_ja

def test_context_packet_excludes_secrets_and_full_logs():
    packet = make_context_packet(state_with_secret_fixture())
    encoded = packet.to_json()
    assert "POSTIZ_API_KEY" not in encoded
    assert len(encoded) <= 60000
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_model_runner.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_agent_brain.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the isolated runner**

Port the proven Writer runner contract into Affiliate-owned state. Terra-high is
the only default strategic route. Sol-high accepts declared one-use triggers.
Provider failure returns an explicit retryable receipt; it never silently routes
a strategic call to Luna.

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement bounded context and JSON-schema output**

The packet contains goal, state hash, eligible offers, recent receipts, waits,
budget, last lesson, and tool schemas. Reject multiple actions, unknown tools,
missing risk/idempotency/verification, and non-Japanese human summary.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN and process-boundary replay**

### Task F3: Create the prompt provenance registry and licensed seed pack

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/prompt_registry.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/prompt-seeds.json`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/prompts/system.md`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/prompts/research.md`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/prompts/content.md`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/prompts/recovery.md`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_prompt_registry.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: immutable `PromptVersion`, active role mapping, mutation proposal, and rollback hash.
- Consumes: licensed prompt sources or paraphrased public workflow evidence.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing provenance tests**

```python
def test_exact_copy_requires_compatible_license(tmp_path):
    with pytest.raises(PromptProvenanceInvariant):
        registry(tmp_path).register(seed(exact_copy=True, license="unknown"))

def test_public_creator_pattern_is_marked_paraphrase(tmp_path):
    row = registry(tmp_path).register(seed(
        source_url="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/blog/5-figure-jv-affiliate-promotion/",
        evidence_class="public_workflow",
        exact_copy=False,
    ))
    assert row.adaptation_kind == "paraphrased_pattern"

def test_prompt_mutation_changes_one_field_and_keeps_rollback(tmp_path):
    base = registry(tmp_path).register(seed_fixture())
    candidate = registry(tmp_path).mutate(base.prompt_id, {"cta_rule": "one measurable CTA"})
    assert candidate.changed_fields == ("cta_rule",)
    assert candidate.parent_sha256 == base.prompt_sha256
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_prompt_registry.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Register seed provenance**

Use MIT-licensed Affitor prompt structures as exact-copy candidates only after
recording repository URL, license, source file, and source hash. Store Pat Flynn,
Michelle, Rakuten, afb, and X creator material only as paraphrased workflow
patterns with evidence class and URL.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement immutable activation and rollback**

Active role mapping points to hashes, not mutable files. Activation requires an
evaluation receipt; rollback restores the prior hash. Unknown-source prompt text
cannot enter a production packet.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run GREEN, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_prompt_registry.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): register licensed prompt provenance"
git push
```

### Task F4: Build the semantic CloakBrowser tool harness

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/browser_harness.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/browser-tools.json`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_browser_harness.py`
- Reuse: `skills/_shared/browser/ensure_browser.sh`
- Reuse: `skills/_shared/browser/scripts/cdp_context_lease.py`
- Reuse: `skills/_shared/browser/scripts/scout.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `observe`, `navigate`, `act`, `download`, `verify`, and `BrowserReceipt`.
- Consumes: one task-owned CDP lease or one dedicated configured profile, semantic action schema, and expected change.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing lease and identity tests**

```python
def test_browser_action_requires_owned_lease(fake_cdp):
    with pytest.raises(BrowserInvariant, match="lease"):
        BrowserHarness(fake_cdp).act(action_fixture())

def test_side_effect_requires_expected_account_identity(fake_cdp):
    harness = BrowserHarness(fake_cdp, expected_identity="@anicca_en")
    fake_cdp.identity = "@someone_else"
    with pytest.raises(BrowserInvariant, match="identity"):
        harness.act(post_action())
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing semantic verification tests**

```python
def test_model_cannot_supply_raw_javascript(fake_cdp):
    with pytest.raises(BrowserInvariant):
        BrowserHarness(fake_cdp).act({"operation": "evaluate", "script": "fetch('/x')"})

def test_dom_drift_returns_replan_not_selector_retry(fake_cdp):
    fake_cdp.change_dom_after_observe = True
    result = BrowserHarness(fake_cdp).act(click_semantic("Export report"))
    assert result.status == "REPLAN_REQUIRED"
    assert result.attempts == 1
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_browser_harness.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement tool allowlist and browser receipts**

Public observation invokes CRWL. Authenticated observation/action acquires a CDP
context lease or dedicated profile, verifies identity, records before/after URL
and observation hashes, expected/actual change, and always releases/heartbeats
the lease. Selectors and raw CDP stay inside the harness.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add recovery tests**

Cover dead `:9222`, expired lease, orphan GC, login loss, CAPTCHA/auth-required,
download timeout, and changed DOM. Each returns a typed wait/quarantine/replan
state instead of an infinite retry.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_browser_harness.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): add semantic CloakBrowser harness"
git push
```

### Task F5: Journal every meaningful action and deliver natural-language Telegram receipts

**Files:**
- Create: `lib/telegram_outbox.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/action_events.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/telegram_report.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_action_events.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_telegram_outbox.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_gig_telegram_contract.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `ActionEvent`, `enqueue_event()`, immediate/digest delivery, and provider `message_id`.
- Consumes: action proposal, execution/verification receipts, money delta, and next automatic action.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing natural-language envelope tests**

```python
def test_external_action_message_explains_full_boundary():
    event = build_event(external_action_fixture())
    assert event.human_message_ja
    for field in ("見た", "選んだ", "結果", "証拠", "次"):
        assert field in event.human_message_ja

def test_low_level_browser_steps_group_under_one_semantic_action():
    event = build_event(browser_steps_fixture(count=7))
    assert event.kind == "provider_report_download"
    assert event.low_level_step_count == 7
    assert event.telegram_message_count == 1

def test_money_event_exposes_truth_and_next_action_without_secrets():
    event = build_event(approved_commission_fixture())
    for field in ("MONEY", "approved", "net", "証拠", "次", "snapshot"):
        assert field in event.human_message_ja
    assert "API_KEY" not in event.human_message_ja

def test_normal_operation_never_waits_for_telegram_reply():
    event = build_event(publication_success_fixture())
    assert event.requires_reply is False
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing at-most-once tests**

```python
def test_same_event_is_sent_once_and_stores_message_id(outbox, transport):
    outbox.enqueue(event_fixture())
    first = outbox.dispatch(transport)
    second = outbox.dispatch(transport)
    assert first.message_id == "tg-9001"
    assert second.status == "queue_empty"
    assert transport.calls == 1

def test_ambiguous_send_is_not_blind_retried(outbox, ambiguous_transport):
    outbox.enqueue(event_fixture())
    assert outbox.dispatch(ambiguous_transport).status == "delivery_unknown"
    assert outbox.dispatch(ambiguous_transport).status == "queue_empty"
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_action_events.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_telegram_outbox.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Extract the proven shared outbox with compatibility import**

Move the Gig Work implementation to `lib/telegram_outbox.py`; leave its original
module as a compatibility import. Preserve fencing tokens, leases, send-started,
`delivery_unknown`, provider ACK reconciliation, file mode `0600`, and existing
Gig behavior.

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement immediate and ordered-digest routing**

External side effects, failure, money, safety, quarantine, model escalation, and
KEEP/REVERT enqueue immediately. Successful internal observation actions keep
their own ledger row and enter the same-hour ordered digest. Every message stores
the same event key and snapshot hash as the Agent feed. Daily close MUST contain
placements, clicks, transaction states, costs, net, blockers, recovery, and next
capacity allocation. Weekly close MUST contain mature KEEP/REVERT decisions,
concentration, reversal risk, and gate progress. Telegram is reporting-only for
normal operation; no eligible queue item waits for a reply.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN and Gig regressions**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_action_events.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_telegram_outbox.py -q
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_gig_telegram_contract.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit and push**

```bash
git add lib/telegram_outbox.py skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): report every semantic action to Telegram"
git push
```


### Task F6: Implement the durable work queue and bounded replanner

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/work_queue.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/planner.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/action_guard.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_work_queue.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_planner.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `WorkItem`, `claim_next()`, `complete()`, `wait()`, `resume_expired()`, and `AgentPlan`.
- Consumes: goal/state hashes, dependencies, budgets, action proposals, and verification receipts.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing lease/fencing tests**

```python
def test_two_wakes_claim_one_item_once(queue):
    item = queue.enqueue(work_fixture())
    first = queue.claim_next(owner="wake-a", now=100)
    second = queue.claim_next(owner="wake-b", now=100)
    assert first.work_id == item.work_id
    assert second is None

def test_expired_lease_resumes_same_item_and_idempotency(queue):
    item = queue.enqueue(work_fixture(idempotency_key="publish:abc"))
    queue.claim_next(owner="dead", now=100, lease_seconds=30)
    resumed = queue.claim_next(owner="wake-b", now=131)
    assert resumed.work_id == item.work_id
    assert resumed.idempotency_key == "publish:abc"
    assert resumed.fencing_token == 2
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing independence and budget tests**

```python
def test_waiting_auth_does_not_block_research(queue):
    queue.enqueue(work_fixture(kind="provider_auth", state="WAITING", retry_at=500))
    queue.enqueue(work_fixture(kind="market_research", state="READY"))
    assert queue.claim_next(owner="wake", now=100).kind == "market_research"

def test_publication_budget_does_not_block_reconciliation(planner):
    plan = planner.plan(state(publication_budget_remaining=0))
    assert "publish" not in [x.kind for x in plan.work_items]
    assert "reconcile" in [x.kind for x in plan.work_items]

def test_planner_cannot_schedule_unknown_tool(planner):
    with pytest.raises(ActionGuardInvariant):
        planner.accept(model_plan(tool="arbitrary_shell"))
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_work_queue.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_planner.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement SQLite queue and legal transitions**

Use `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, one lease owner, monotonic fencing token, dependency checks,
bounded attempts, explicit `READY/CLAIMED/WAITING/VERIFIED/FAILED/QUARANTINED`,
and append-only transition receipts.

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement the bounded replanner**

The planner may order eligible work and request one Agent action. The action guard
checks tool, origin, current state, budget, idempotency, and verification before
the executor sees it. Replanning cannot delete money/recovery work.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN, crash replay, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_work_queue.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_planner.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): add durable agent work queue"
git push
```


### Task 1: Establish isolated baselines and the Affiliate skill root

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/SKILL.md`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/providers.json`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_skill_contract.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Writer Agent canonical paths and the design spec.
- Produces: the only Affiliate runtime root and provider schema version `1`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create one clean worktree from the pushed canonical Life Manager branch**

```bash
cd /Users/anicca/anicca-project
git fetch --all --prune
git worktree add .worktrees/affiliate-agent -b feature/affiliate-agent canonical/main
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Record baseline status and test results**

```bash
git -C /Users/anicca/anicca-project/.worktrees/affiliate-agent status --short
npm --prefix /Users/anicca/anicca-project/.worktrees/affiliate-agent/apps/api test -- --run
```

Expected: the worktree is clean and existing suites pass before Affiliate edits.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing identity test**

```python
def test_affiliate_skill_has_one_canonical_runtime_root():
    root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]
    assert "Affiliate Agent" in (root / "SKILL.md").read_text()
    payload = json.loads((root / "config/providers.json").read_text())
    assert payload == {"schema_version": 1, "providers": []}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_skill_contract.py -q
```

Expected: FAIL because the skill and config do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the minimal skill and registry**

`SKILL.md` names the design, separates Writer revenue, lists `hourly`, `daily`,
`reconcile`, `report`, and `status`, and forbids money without external receipts.
`providers.json` exactly matches the test fixture.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_skill_contract.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): establish canonical runtime root"
git push -u origin feature/affiliate-agent-runtime
```

### Task 2: Implement canonical contracts and the immutable Affiliate ledger

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/contracts.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/ledger.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_ledger.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `AffiliateLedger`, account/offer/placement/click/commission/payout append methods, and `snapshot()`.
- Consumes: integer amounts, ISO currency, external IDs, hashes, and timezone-aware timestamps.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing money invariant tests**

```python
def test_unknown_commission_is_not_zero(tmp_path):
    ledger = AffiliateLedger(tmp_path / "affiliate.sqlite")
    ledger.append_commission({**commission_fixture(), "status": "pending", "amount_minor": None})
    assert ledger.snapshot()["approved"] == {}

def test_reversal_appends_without_mutating_approval(tmp_path):
    ledger = AffiliateLedger(tmp_path / "affiliate.sqlite")
    approved = ledger.append_commission(commission_fixture())
    ledger.append_commission(reversal_fixture(approved["receipt_id"]))
    assert ledger.receipt(approved["receipt_id"])["status"] == "approved"
    assert ledger.count("commission_receipts") == 2

def test_external_transaction_replay_is_idempotent(tmp_path):
    ledger = AffiliateLedger(tmp_path / "affiliate.sqlite")
    a = ledger.append_commission(commission_fixture())
    b = ledger.append_commission(commission_fixture())
    assert a["receipt_id"] == b["receipt_id"]
    assert ledger.count("commission_receipts") == 1
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_ledger.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the schema and validators**

Create all records from design section 7. Enforce foreign keys, WAL, busy timeout,
account-scoped provider transaction uniqueness, append-only reversal linkage,
source SHA-256, and timezone-aware timestamps.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement currency-separated snapshots**

`snapshot()` returns approved, paid, reversed, pending, fee, and net maps keyed by
currency. It excludes test/self-funded rows and performs no implicit FX.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run GREEN and Python 3.9 compilation**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_ledger.py -q
/usr/bin/python3 -m py_compile skills/affiliate/scripts/contracts.py skills/affiliate/scripts/ledger.py
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit and push**

```bash
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): add receipt-backed commission ledger"
git push
```

### Task 3: Build generic provider connectors and verified playbooks

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/providers/base.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/providers/api_connector.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/providers/browser_connector.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/providers/report_connector.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/providers/recipe_registry.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/provider-playbooks/amazon-jp.json`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/provider-playbooks/rakuten-jp.json`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_providers.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: connector protocol, candidate/verified/retired `ProviderRecipe`, `read_account()`,
  `list_offers()`, and `read_transactions(cursor)`.
- Consumes: provider-owned API/report/auth readbacks and semantic browser receipts;
  directories and model proposals supply candidates only.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing connector and recipe tests**

```python
def test_logged_out_account_is_not_executable():
    account = BrowserConnector(amazon_recipe(), FakeBrowser("sign-in-page.html")).read_account()
    assert account.auth_state == "AUTH_REQUIRED"
    assert account.executable is False

def test_verified_browser_recipe_adds_provider_without_python_module(registry):
    registry.verify(recipe(provider="new-asp", connector="browser"), verification_receipt())
    assert registry.connector_for("new-asp").list_offers()[0].source_sha256

def test_generated_recipe_cannot_expand_allowed_origins(registry):
    with pytest.raises(OriginPolicyError):
        registry.propose(recipe(origins=("https://untrusted.example",)))

def test_ui_drift_quarantines_only_one_recipe(registry):
    result = registry.execute("amazon-jp", changed_dom_receipt())
    assert result.state == "RECIPE_QUARANTINED"
    assert registry.state("rakuten-jp") == "VERIFIED"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_providers.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement fail-closed connector and recipe contracts**

Keep provider identity and mutable browser steps in signed JSON recipes, not
provider-specific Python modules. A candidate recipe becomes executable only after
origin, auth, selector/readback, terms, and rollback verification. Expired or drifted
recipes re-enter discovery and cannot silently broaden permissions.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement normalized accounts, offers, reports, and cursor state**

An offer requires account identity, current official terms, affiliate ID/tag,
allowed channel, and verified destination host. Normalize pending, approved,
reversed, and paid while retaining raw payload hash and external transaction ID.
Never infer a missing amount.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run GREEN, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_providers.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_ledger.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): add verified provider playbooks"
git push
```

### Task 4: Build the public placement redirect and internal click API

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Create: `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20260805090000_affiliate_click_attribution/migration.sql`
- Create: `apps/api/src/services/affiliateClickService.js`
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/affiliate/index.js`
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/affiliate/click.js`
- Create: `apps/api/src/routes/affiliate/internal.js`
- Test: `apps/api/src/routes/affiliate/__tests__/click.test.js`
- Modify: `apps/api/src/routes/index.js`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: placement create/disable, cursor click reads, and `GET /api/affiliate/c/:token`.
- Consumes: registered placement/destination, expiry, HMAC secret, and internal auth.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing redirect and open-redirect tests**

```javascript
it('persists a click and redirects only to the registered destination', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/api/affiliate/c/opaque-token');
  expect(response.status).toBe(302);
  expect(response.headers.location).toBe('https://approved.example/product?subid=click-1');
  expect(store.clicks).toHaveLength(1);
});

it('ignores attacker-controlled destination input', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/api/affiliate/c/opaque-token?url=https://evil.example');
  expect(response.headers.location).not.toContain('evil.example');
});
```

Also cover missing `404`, disabled/expired `410`, persistence failure `503`,
internal auth rejection, and public rate limiting.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED**

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api test -- src/routes/affiliate/__tests__/click.test.js
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add Prisma models and migration**

Create `AffiliatePlacement` and append-only `AffiliateClick` with opaque token
hash, active/expiry state, destination, sub-ID capability, artifact/experiment
lineage, timestamps, and unique click ID. Store no raw IP.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement service and routes**

Append a click before `302`, add sub-ID only from provider configuration, rate
limit public clicks, and protect internal routes with existing agent auth.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run focused and route suites**

```bash
npm --prefix apps/api test -- src/routes/affiliate/__tests__/click.test.js src/routes/agent/__tests__/agent.test.js
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit and push the API slice**

```bash
git add apps/api/prisma apps/api/src/routes/affiliate apps/api/src/services/affiliateClickService.js apps/api/src/routes/index.js
git commit -m "feat(api): add affiliate redirect and click receipts"
git push -u origin feature/affiliate-agent-api
```

### Task 5: Connect runtime placement creation and click ingestion

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/click_sync.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_click_sync.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `create_placement()` and `sync_clicks(cursor)`.
- Consumes: internal Life Manager API and Affiliate ledger.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing idempotency and cursor tests**

```python
def test_create_replay_returns_same_token(fake_api, ledger):
    a = create_placement(placement_fixture(), fake_api, ledger)
    b = create_placement(placement_fixture(), fake_api, ledger)
    assert a.token == b.token
    assert fake_api.create_calls == 1

def test_cursor_advances_only_after_page_commit(fake_api, ledger):
    fake_api.fail_on_row = 2
    with pytest.raises(SyncFailure):
        sync_clicks("cursor-1", fake_api, ledger)
    assert ledger.get_cursor("clicks") == "cursor-1"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement authenticated time-bounded requests**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_click_sync.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Hash API receipts and commit each page atomically**

Validate returned placement identity and advance the cursor only after the whole
page commits.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run GREEN, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_click_sync.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_ledger.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): sync placements and click receipts"
git push
```

### Task 6: Implement official evidence packs and fail-closed policy

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/policy-rules.json`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/config/crawler-adapters.json`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/crawler_registry.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/source_capture.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/evidence.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/policy.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_crawler_registry.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_evidence_policy.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `SourceCapture`, `CrawlerAdapterReceipt`, `EvidencePack`,
  `PolicyDecision`, and `evaluate()`.
- Consumes: CRWL/gh/public-X/PRAW/Apify/Crawlee bodies, hashes, parser versions,
  TTL, disclosure, and channel rules.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing adapter/failure-class tests**

Assert route order, immutable raw hash, parser version, bounded pagination,
idempotent recapture, and explicit `EMPTY|AUTH|RATE_LIMIT|PARSER|POLICY|UPSTREAM`
failure. No adapter may silently launch a duplicate browser or rotate accounts.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement the minimum audited routes**

Wire installed CRWL and `gh` first, then read-only `x-tweet-fetcher` and PRAW.
Apify actors require fetched schema plus one-item live dataset receipt before
admission. Add Crawlee only for a measured durable multi-page/JS need.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write failing freshness and disclosure tests**

```python
def test_stale_price_fails_closed():
    decision = evaluate(manifest(), offer(), evidence(price_age_days=8, ttl_days=7))
    assert decision.status == "FAIL"
    assert "stale_price" in decision.reasons

def test_disclosure_must_precede_first_affiliate_cta():
    decision = evaluate(manifest(disclosure_offset=400, first_cta_offset=120), offer(), evidence())
    assert decision.status == "FAIL"
    assert "disclosure_after_cta" in decision.reasons
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run RED and implement exact claim-to-source binding**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_evidence_policy.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement locale/channel disclosures and category quarantine**

Include JA/EN general disclosure, Amazon statement, channel allowlists, prohibited
brand bidding, unsafe-category default denial, and source freshness. A model
cannot override deterministic failure.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run GREEN, live-read one source per admitted route, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_crawler_registry.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_evidence_policy.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): gate evidence claims and disclosures"
git push
```

### Task 7: Build locale-isolated content manifests and the Writer bridge

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/content.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/writer_bridge.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_content.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_writer_contract.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: immutable `ContentManifest` and Writer input bundle.
- Consumes: reader job, primary offer, up to two alternatives, evidence, locale, disclosure, and experiment.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing reader-job/localization tests**

```python
def test_manifest_rejects_three_alternatives():
    with pytest.raises(ContentInvariant):
        build_manifest(**fixture(alternative_offer_ids=["a", "b", "c"]))

def test_ja_and_en_require_independent_offer_snapshots():
    with pytest.raises(ContentInvariant, match="locale offer snapshot"):
        build_pair(ja_offer=ja_offer(), en_offer=ja_offer())

def test_manifest_rejects_account_locale_mismatch():
    with pytest.raises(ContentInvariant, match="account locale"):
        build_manifest(**fixture(locale="en", account_locale="ja"))
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement hash-bound manifests**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_content.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the narrow Writer bridge**

Pass reader job, evidence, structure, locale, and output paths. Record the Writer
contract/version/hash. Never read or write Writer money/topic state.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run Affiliate and Writer contract tests**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_content.py -q
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_writer_contract.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit and push**

```bash
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): isolate decision manifests by locale"
git push
```

### Task 8: Publish owned and X placements through the browser with public readback

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/publisher.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_publisher.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `PublishIntent`, provider publish receipt, and `PublicReadback`.
- Consumes: policy-passed content, redirect token, isolated browser lease, and verified account identity.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing duplicate/readback tests**

```python
def test_replay_does_not_create_second_post(fake_browser, ledger):
    publish(placement(), fake_browser, ledger)
    publish(placement(), fake_browser, ledger)
    assert fake_browser.submit_calls == 1

def test_readback_requires_disclosure_and_redirect(fake_browser, ledger):
    fake_browser.public_body = "content without disclosure"
    assert publish(placement(), fake_browser, ledger).status == "RECOVER"

def test_publisher_rejects_wrong_browser_identity(fake_browser, ledger):
    fake_browser.account_handle = "japanese-account"
    with pytest.raises(PublishInvariant, match="integration identity"):
        publish(english_placement(), fake_browser, ledger)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement the idempotent intent journal**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_publisher.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement browser and owned-page adapters**

Require a pre-submit content fingerprint, post-submit URL/ID when rendered, and
fresh public readback. If submit result is ambiguous, search the live account and
ledger before retry. X account identity must match the leased profile receipt.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run GREEN and Writer isolation regression**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_publisher.py -q
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_writer_contract.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit and push**

```bash
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): publish receipted browser placements"
git push
```

### Task 9: Reconcile conversions, commissions, reversals, and payouts

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/reconcile.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_reconcile.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `matched`, `unmatched`, `conflict`, and cursor receipts.
- Consumes: normalized transactions, placements, clicks, and ledger.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing match and reversal tests**

```python
def test_subid_match_beats_time_proximity(ledger):
    receipt = reconcile(transaction(sub_id="click-b"), ledger_with_clicks("click-a", "click-b"))
    assert receipt.click_id == "click-b"

def test_missing_subid_does_not_guess_by_time(ledger):
    assert reconcile(transaction(sub_id=None), ledger).status == "unmatched"

def test_reversal_preserves_approval_receipt(ledger):
    reconcile(approved_transaction(), ledger)
    reconcile(reversed_transaction(), ledger)
    assert ledger.count("commission_receipts") == 2
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement deterministic precedence**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_reconcile.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement cursor-safe batches and conflict quarantine**

Provider cursor advances only after all rows append. Conflicting identity,
amount, or currency becomes explicit conflict and never overwrites.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run GREEN twice, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_reconcile.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_ledger.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): reconcile provider commissions"
git push
```

### Task 10: Implement allocation and bounded learning

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/allocator.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/learning.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_learning.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: allocation, experiment assignment, and `KEEP|REVERT|INCONCLUSIVE`.
- Consumes: mature cohorts, costs, concentration, exploration rate, and one changed field.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing exploration/concentration/causal tests**

```python
def test_allocator_reserves_twenty_percent_exploration():
    result = allocate(portfolio(), capacity=10)
    assert len([x for x in result if x.mode == "explore"]) >= 2

def test_candidate_cannot_change_two_fields():
    with pytest.raises(ExperimentInvariant):
        assign(baseline(), candidate(hook="new", cta="new"))

def test_reversal_harm_forces_revert():
    assert decide(cohort(net_delta=100, reversal_delta=2)).decision == "REVERT"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement uncertainty-aware allocation**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_learning.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement maturity and strategy-consumption receipts**

Require same-age comparable cohorts and ten mature placements unless a stronger
paid outcome closes deterministically. Only `KEEP` changes active strategy.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run GREEN, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_learning.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): allocate from mature net receipts"
git push
```

### Task 11: Implement durable orchestration, waits, and recovery

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/orchestrator.py`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/recovery.py`
- Modify after migration parity: `skills/affiliate/run.sh`
- Modify after migration parity: `skills/affiliate/affiliate-cli.sh`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_orchestrator.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_recovery.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `hourly_wake()`, `daily_wake()`, `resume(run_id)`, legal transitions, and quarantines.
- Consumes: the F6 queue/planner, one guarded Agent action at a time, and prior
  components through explicit interfaces.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing crash and isolation tests**

```python
def test_crash_after_publish_receipt_resumes_without_repost(harness):
    harness.crash_after("provider_receipt")
    with pytest.raises(SimulatedCrash):
        harness.daily()
    harness.resume()
    assert harness.browser.publish_calls == 1
    assert harness.state == "MEASURE"

def test_auth_failure_quarantines_one_account(harness):
    harness.amazon.auth_fails = True
    result = harness.hourly()
    assert result.accounts["amazon-jp"] == "QUARANTINED"
    assert result.accounts["rakuten-jp"] == "ACTIVE"

def test_hourly_wake_claims_one_durable_item_not_a_fixed_script(harness):
    result = harness.hourly()
    assert result.claimed_work_id == harness.queue.first_ready_id
    assert result.semantic_actions_executed == 1
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement legal state transitions**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_orchestrator.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_recovery.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement durable wait/retry ownership**

Store external reason, owner, retry time, attempt count, and independent work.
Honor `Retry-After`; move permanent failures to quarantine.

- [ ] **Step 4: Cut legacy entrypoints over after migration and orchestrator parity**

Require the F1 migration receipt. `affiliate-cli.sh --status` reports the new
orchestrator plus migration state; `run.sh` delegates one bounded wake. The old
fixed Instagram/Amazon behavior remains callable only through an explicitly
named legacy fixture path and is not scheduled. Prove status and wake behavior
with executable wrapper tests before changing scheduling.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run crash matrix GREEN, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_orchestrator.py skills/affiliate/tests/test_recovery.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): add same-run recovery"
git push
```

### Task 12: Generate one money-first Web/Telegram snapshot

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/report.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_report.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `latest.json`, `index.html`, Telegram text, and one semantic SHA-256.
- Consumes: ledger, runs, waits, quarantines, experiments, public URLs, and gates.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing parity/currency tests**

```python
def test_web_and_telegram_share_hash(tmp_path):
    output = build_report(fixture(), tmp_path)
    assert output.web_hash == output.telegram_hash

def test_multicurrency_has_no_unreceipted_total(tmp_path):
    output = build_report(multicurrency_fixture(), tmp_path)
    assert output.snapshot["total_usd"] is None
    assert output.snapshot["by_currency"] == {"JPY": 5000, "USD": 40}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED and implement canonical rendering**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_report.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Render money, health, gates, and next action**

Separate approved, paid, reversed, pending, unknown, net, and cost. Show public
URLs, run, quarantine, retry, software/A1/A3/$10M gates, and next owner action.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run GREEN, inspect 390px fixture, commit, and push**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_report.py -q
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): report money and runtime health"
git push
```

### Task 13: Install and verify launchd ownership

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/affiliate/launchd/ai.anicca.affiliate-reconcile.plist`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/launchd/ai.anicca.affiliate-daily.plist`
- Create: `skills/affiliate/scripts/install.sh`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_launchd_wiring.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: installed labels, locks, logs, status receipts, and immediate kickstart.
- Consumes: protected env, canonical root, and Python 3.9 entrypoints.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing plist tests**

```python
def test_plists_use_canonical_root_and_run_at_load():
    for path in PLISTS:
        payload = plistlib.loads(path.read_bytes())
        assert payload["RunAtLoad"] is True
        command = " ".join(payload["ProgramArguments"])
        assert "/.local/share/life-manager/affiliate/current/" in command
        assert "/.worktrees/" not in command
        assert "/profitable-claude/" not in command
        assert payload["StandardOutPath"] != payload["StandardErrorPath"]
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run RED; implement plists and idempotent installer**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_launchd_wiring.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run GREEN and Python 3.9 compilation**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_launchd_wiring.py -q
/usr/bin/python3 -m compileall -q skills/affiliate/scripts
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit and push before live state changes**

```bash
git add skills/affiliate
git commit -m "feat(affiliate): install autonomous workers"
git push
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Install, kickstart, and observe real exits**

```bash
bash skills/affiliate/scripts/install.sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.anicca.affiliate-reconcile
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.anicca.affiliate-daily
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/ai.anicca.affiliate-reconcile
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/ai.anicca.affiliate-daily
```

Expected: jobs exist; last exit is `0` or explicit receipted external wait; no
duplicate placement is produced.

### Task 14: Deploy the redirect and prove live HTTPS click E2E

**Files:**
- Modify only if evidence requires: `apps/api/railway.toml`
- Update: `docs/affiliate-agent/AFFILIATE-AGENT-SSOT.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: deployment hash, placement receipt, click receipt, and `302` readback.
- Consumes: merged API slice and protected HMAC/internal auth.

- [ ] **Step 1: Push the API slice through the configured deployment branch**

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git log -1 --format=%H
git push canonical HEAD:dev
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify Railway's exact deployment commit and health**

Repository presence alone is insufficient; deployment state/logs are authority.

- [ ] **Step 3: Create one short-lived `test=true` placement**

Use a controlled HTTPS destination. Test clicks never enter revenue.

- [ ] **Step 4: Call the public URL and verify redirect plus durable click**

```bash
test -n "$AFFILIATE_API_BASE"
test -n "$AFFILIATE_TEST_TOKEN"
curl -sS -D /tmp/affiliate-click-headers.txt -o /dev/null \
  "$AFFILIATE_API_BASE/api/affiliate/c/$AFFILIATE_TEST_TOKEN"
```

Verify `302`, exact destination, and internal cursor endpoint click ID. Repeat and
confirm two click IDs but one placement.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record only sanitized hashes and deployment evidence; commit/push**

No token, credential, raw IP, or personal identifier enters git.

### Task 15: Execute English E0, then unlock an isolated Japanese canary

**Files:**
- Runtime state: `${LIFE_MANAGER_STATE_HOME}/affiliate/`
- Update: `docs/affiliate-agent/AFFILIATE-AGENT-SSOT.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: one live English decision asset with policy, publish, readback,
  redirect, and click receipts; then unlocks registration/readback of a separate
  pre-existing Japanese canary identity.
- Consumes: actually authenticated executable offers.

- [ ] **Step 1: Let the Agent provision and read back `@selawmqt` through its isolated browser**

Browser readback now proves `sela` / `@selawmqt`: stored credentials produced an
X `auth_token`, `/home`, and profile link `/selawmqt` in the isolated
`capafy-mkt-provision` profile. Legacy `@aniccaen` is inactive. The runtime must
reproduce profile provisioning, login/recovery, identity readback, and session
persistence from its authorized vault. It never calls Postiz or an X publishing
API. X's suspension warning remains a quarantined external risk.

- [ ] **Step 1A: Make `@selawmqt` an English-only Affiliate-ready identity**

Public readback shows 128 historical mixed JA/EN posts, display name `sela`, 27
following, and 0 followers. Before E0, set an English Anicca display name, bio,
owned-page link, and hard-to-miss affiliate disclosure. Keep historical posts;
all future Affiliate placements and account-level copy are English-only.

- [ ] **Step 2: Read back English provider ownership and an executable offer**

Store account identity hash, official terms hash, channel rules, destination,
tag/sub-ID capability, and auth state. Logged-out Amazon/Rakuten stays
`AUTH_REQUIRED`; prefer a current non-regulated B2B/creator software program,
but use only the provider that returns real ownership and executable-link receipts.

Live checkpoint: Kit returned a rendered `Application received!` confirmation
after a truthful browser submission and is `APPLICATION_PENDING`; do not reapply.
Amazon Associates JP found an existing Amazon.co.jp account and sent a recovery
OTP, but no authorized mail session could read it, so it is
`AUTH_RECOVERY_OTP_REQUIRED` and no Associates application was submitted. This
step remains open until approval, ownership, current terms, payout readiness, and
an executable tracking link are all read back.

- [ ] **Step 3: Build one current English evidence pack**

Bind official claims, locale availability, reader problem, primary offer,
alternatives, disclosure, TTL, and exact hashes.

- [ ] **Step 4: Publish owned content, then eligible browser/X distribution**

Capture the rendered publication ID/URL. The owned registered page contains the
measurable CTA. Use only a placement pattern whose current rendered result and
provider terms are receipted. This is a real side effect, not a dry run.

- [ ] **Step 5: Perform public readback and marked test clicks**

Verify rendered disclosure, redirect, destination, placement lineage, and durable
clicks. Mark test clicks so they cannot count as revenue.

- [ ] **Step 6: Prove isolated crash resume**

Use a sandbox adapter to crash after provider receipt; resume the same intent
without duplicate. Do not stop an unrelated production loop.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run complete Affiliate and Writer suites**

```bash
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests -q
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_writer_contract.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Close E0 and read back the Japanese canary identity**

E0 closes from the English public readback, redirect, and provider click/sub-ID
receipt. Only then let the Agent discover/create/recover and read a dedicated
authorized Japanese account in a separate browser profile. If required identity
authority is unavailable, record `EXTERNAL_CHALLENGE`; never fabricate it.
English credentials, history, cohorts, experiments, and budgets are not copied.

- [ ] **Step 9: Record sanitized receipts, commit, and push the canonical repository**

English E0 closes independently. Japanese J0 remains open until its later public
readback and click lineage. Revenue remains unknown until an external transaction.

### Task 16: Close English E1 with the first external approved commission

**Files:**
- Runtime receipt state only.
- Update: `docs/affiliate-agent/AFFILIATE-AGENT-SSOT.md`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: transaction, commission, attribution/unmatched, and payout-state receipts.
- Consumes: a real non-test provider report.

- [ ] **Step 1: Keep hourly reconciliation active until a transaction appears**

Independent publishing, health checks, and reports continue. Reporting delay does
not become zero revenue.

- [ ] **Step 2: Import the transaction twice**

First import creates one canonical receipt. Replay returns the same receipt and
row count.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify attribution strength**

Join by provider transaction and sub-ID/click where available. Otherwise retain
`unmatched`; never guess from time.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify money state**

Pending does not close E1. Approved non-test English commission closes E1. Paid requires
a payout receipt. Later reversal appends and changes net reporting.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify report parity and record sanitized gate evidence**

Commit/push provider, currency, artifact, receipt IDs/hashes, state, and observed
time without secrets.

### Task 16J: Execute the isolated Japanese J0/J1 canary after English E0

**Files:**
- Runtime state: locale-isolated Japanese provider, identity, and ledger rows.
- Update: `docs/affiliate-agent/AFFILIATE-AGENT-SSOT.md`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Read back Japanese identity and one executable offer**

Require a Japanese-owned account, terms, link, registered surface, and fresh
`ChannelEligibilityReceipt`. A8 X/LINE direct advertising remains rejected;
regulated/high-ticket offers remain quarantined.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build an independently localized Japanese evidence pack**

Do not translate English claims mechanically. Require Japanese disclosures and
an `ExperienceClaimReceipt` for any first-person usage claim.

- [ ] **Step 3: Publish one Japanese owned-page canary and verify J0**

Capture policy, publication, public readback, signed redirect, and marked click
receipts without sharing English history, budget, or cohorts.

- [ ] **Step 4: Reconcile the first non-test approved Japanese commission for J1**

Keep `pending`, `approved`, `reversed`, and `paid` separate; preserve `unmatched`
rather than inferring attribution.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify locale isolation, record receipts, commit, and push**

Prove that English and Japanese identities, credentials, placements, cohorts,
experiments, and budgets cannot cross.

### Task 17: Operate the positive-week and $10k gates

**Files:**
- Runtime ledgers/reports only.
- Update gate rows: `docs/affiliate-agent/AFFILIATE-AGENT-SSOT.md`.

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: four positive weeks, then three qualifying $10k months.
- Consumes: mature net cohorts and bounded experiments.

- [ ] **Step 1: Require four net-positive closed weeks before capacity growth**

Verify approved gross, reversals, fees, compute, acquisition, net, unmatched
transactions, and publication health.

- [ ] **Step 2: Promote only receipted combinations**

Every promotion links baseline/candidate, mature window, one changed variable,
decision, rollback hash, and later strategy consumption.

- [ ] **Step 3: Improve terms only after measured fit**

Use actual volume, approval rate, reversal rate, and reader fit for ASP special
rates/direct partner deals. Advertised payout alone gains no capacity.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add one budget-capped pod at a time**

A pod is language/region, buyer problem, content cluster, and provider portfolio.
No pod exceeds canary capacity before mature positive net evidence.

- [ ] **Step 5: Close each month from provider receipts**

Keep currencies separate. A displayed USD equivalent requires a dated FX receipt.
A month passes only with complete approved/reversal state and visible net.

- [ ] **Step 6: Close A3 after three consecutive qualifying months**

Generate gross, approved, paid, reversal, fee, net, unmatched, concentration,
uptime, and manual-intervention evidence; commit/push the SSOT summary.

### Task 17P: Publish the proof ledger and gate product claims

**Files:**
- Create after E1: `skills/affiliate/scripts/public_ledger.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_public_ledger.py`
- Create: `docs/affiliate-agent/PRIOR-ART-REGISTRY.md`
- Modify only after this task passes: `README.md`
- Modify only after this task passes: `apps/landing` Life Manager route

**Interfaces:**
- Produces a privacy-safe, append-only public financial projection and a
  reproducible prior-art/claim receipt.
- Consumes only content-addressed external money receipts and public-safe runtime
  health; secrets and private identifiers are denied fields.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing redaction, ledger-invariant, and claim-gate tests**

Assert that pending is not earned, reversals are visible, net is derived from
receipts, every public row resolves to a redacted hash, and “first” wording is
disabled when any proof prerequisite is absent.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build the public projection and independent verifier**

Export aggregate gross/net/pending/approved/reversed/paid/cost/currency without
credentials, bank/tax data, customer IDs, session material, or provider-private
identifiers. Ship a verifier that recomputes hashes and invariants.

- [ ] **Step 3: Freeze the prior-art registry from reproducible evidence**

Record CRWL/`gh` search routes, query scope, inspected commit, license, code/tests
executed, money boundary, missing boundary, and remaining uncertainty for every
material predecessor.

- [ ] **Step 4: Close the public proof gate with live receipts**

Require canonical public source, reproducible macOS install, E1 approved receipt,
payout receipt when available, public ledger, verifier, and zero secret leak.
An external-money wait keeps the claim disabled; it is not replaced by a mock.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update README and `aniccaai.com/life-manager` with qualified copy**

Use “We are building…” before the gate. After it closes, permit only the
time-scoped “To our knowledge…” affiliate-loop claim linked to the registry and
ledger. Never promise income or claim a generic world-first money loop.

### Task 18: Package the proven recipe for operator-owned installations

**Files:**
- Create after A3: `skills/affiliate/scripts/tenant_contract.py`
- Test after A3: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_tenant_contract.py`
- Create after A3: `docs/affiliate-agent/OPERATOR-INSTALL-CONTRACT.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: isolated accounts, state, disclosure identity, payout ownership, spend cap, and report.
- Consumes: the proven A3 contracts, never shared global credentials.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing tenant isolation tests**

```python
def test_tenants_cannot_share_accounts_or_money():
    a, b = tenant("a"), tenant("b")
    assert a.state_path != b.state_path
    with pytest.raises(TenantInvariant):
        b.import_receipt(a.provider_receipt())
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement identity/KYC/payout/spend-cap gates**

Each operator owns accounts and payouts. Stop at `AUTH_REQUIRED` for personal
contractual actions; never copy cookies, IDs, receipts, or audience data.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement export/deletion and tenant reports**

Money, clicks, experiments, and credentials are isolated. Product copy promises
auditable automation, not income.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run adversarial isolation tests and canary one installation**

Do not roll out publicly until the canary reproduces software E2E under its own
accounts without original-Agent state access.

### Task 19: Scale a diversified network from $10k through $10M to the $100M horizon

**Files:**
- Extend after A3: `skills/affiliate/scripts/allocator.py`
- Extend after A3: `skills/affiliate/scripts/report.py`
- Test: `skills/affiliate/tests/test_scale_controller.py`
- Update: `docs/affiliate-agent/AFFILIATE-AGENT-SSOT.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: budget-capped pod creation, staged promotion, rollback, and network receipts.
- Consumes: proven economics, cash receipts, partner capacity, policy modules, and tenant isolation.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing scale-cap and concentration tests**

```python
def test_unproven_pod_cannot_exceed_canary_budget():
    assert scale(pod(mature=False), requested=1000).approved <= pod().canary_cap

def test_provider_share_over_forty_percent_blocks_scale():
    assert scale(network(provider_share=0.41), requested=100).status == "BLOCKED_CONCENTRATION"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement staged pod promotion and rollback**

Stages are sandbox, canary, limited, production, and scaled. Mature net evidence
advances a stage; reversal, policy, or margin harm rolls back.

- [ ] **Step 3: Close $100k monthly without a dimension above 40%**

Require three months, direct-partner evidence, cost, compliance, and recovery
capacity before adding regions or regulated verticals.

- [ ] **Step 4: Close $1M monthly with direct contracts and multi-region operations**

Receipt provider postbacks/APIs, contract terms, approval delays, finance,
privacy, and legal/KYC boundaries. Search/X cannot be a single point of failure.

- [ ] **Step 5: Grow 25-50 independently proven pods**

Every pod keeps its own economics and rollback. Aggregate volume cannot override
local net-loss, reversal, policy, or concentration stops.

- [ ] **Step 6: Close $10M monthly net only from external receipts**

Require one closed month at $10M equivalent net, no provider/offer/channel/
language above 40%, no internal/self payments, explicit legal/KYC exceptions,
and no routine human production or repair. Publish a sanitized audit; never
claim the result is guaranteed for each operator.

- [ ] **Step 7: Keep $100M as a separately receipted horizon**

Do not relabel GMV, clicks, pending commissions, tenant sales, or projections as
affiliate revenue. The gate closes only for one externally settled month at $100M
equivalent net affiliate commission, with audited currency conversion, reversals,
costs, concentration, policy, partner-capacity, and tenant isolation. Until that
receipt exists, the report must say `HORIZON_OPEN`, never “achieved” or “expected.”

## Final verification commands

```bash
cd /Users/anicca/anicca-project/.worktrees/affiliate-agent
/usr/bin/python3 -m compileall -q skills/affiliate/scripts
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests -q
python3 -m pytest skills/affiliate/tests/test_legacy_writer_contract.py -q

npm --prefix apps/api test -- --run

git status --short
git log -1 --oneline
```

Expected final software evidence:

- focused and regression suites pass;
- redirect deployment matches the pushed commit;
- one live EN placement has policy, publish, readback, redirect, and click
  receipts; software completion is English E0 and does not wait for Japanese;
- the later J0/J1 task independently proves one Japanese placement and
  commission without reopening English software completion;
- launchd workers run without chat and resume without duplicates;
- Web and Telegram use one snapshot hash;
- money remains truthful when external commission is absent;
- A1, A3, and $10M stay open until their exact external receipt contracts pass.
